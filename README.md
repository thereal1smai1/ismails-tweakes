Hey! I made this Minecraft texture pack using that super useful site called Vanilla Tweaks (I used this link: https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/).

The idea was not to drastically change the game. I just wanted to add a lot of small things and details that would make the game nicer and more polished, but always keeping the usual Vanilla style (the original one, that is).
